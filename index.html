          SNOW Whitening Toothpaste is a brand which aimed to target a younger
          audience after successfully attracting older clients in previous
          campaigns. In this advertisement, I aimed to keep the copy simple
          but informative. Additionally, I wanted the pique the viewer's
          interest with the question: “What does yours say?”<br/><br/>

          In the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/10/16453336/gamestop-ad-pre-order-assassins-creed-origins" target="_blank">original GameStop ad</a>, attention is drawn to the fact that the
          game is incomplete. Consumers are discouraged from pre-ordering,
          instead of called to do so. I modified the copy to challenge the
          audience to the bonus mission, instead of reminding them that it is
          exclusive content.
